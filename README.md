# H1 Project 1: First Steps # VEIMEO

The process of learning involves destructive behaviour. In my case, that couldn't be closer to the truth. After hours of work, that culminated with the sentence "Well, there is definitely a way to do this better." I decided to not pursue anything anymore and lay this
little project mine to rest. In this code, that, admittedly, does not try to meet any necessary requirements for modular organization, of which I am definetaly aware of, and is actually a row of ad hoc implementations that are partially the result of quite a lot of marginal frustration.
