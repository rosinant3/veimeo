# H1 Project 1: First Steps # VEIMEO

The process of learning involves destructive behaviour. In my case, that couldn't be closer to the truth. After hours of work, that culminated with the sentence "Well, there is definitely a way to do this better." I decided to not pursue anything anymore and lay this
little project mine to rest. In this code, that, admittedly, does not try to meet any necessary requirements for modular organization, of which I am definetaly aware of, and is actually a row of ad hoc implementations that are partially the result of quite a lot of marginal frustration.

In this readme, I will attempt to make a short description of the main features, that are implemented using HTML, CSS and JS. I have the responsibilty, to make you aware, that this is purely a front-end oriented exercise to test the water in this field. More endeavours are in the works.

The site is made using a combination of JS and HTML. Some of the elements are generated using scripts. That means that the site won't have it's full functionality if JS is not enabled in the browser. The other thing to note is, that it is only optimized to run on Chrome. I did not try to bother with other Browsers yet, because it is not in my range of interests right now. The things that are generated with JS are the search bar/upload button and the 5x3 content gird, about which we will talk about a little bit later.

The site features a navigation bar with a custom made dropdown menu, a search bar that resizes depending on the screen size and a full responsive background video that plays automatically on load. For smaller screen sizes, it includes another nav-bar with removed unnecessary text. CSS gimmics include, onFocus, onHover effects for the respective buttons, forms and text.
